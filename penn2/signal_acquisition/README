Each subdirectory contains a module for interfacing a signal acquisition hardware or a virtual/simulated signal generator.

file_feeder: reads the binary files recorded from the experiements and uzing ZMQ broadcasts one sample at a time
gtec: interfaces with gtec ghiamp
tdt: interfaces with TDT PO8e
imitator: uses reach state equation to generate simulated bio-signal
kinect: uses kinect to track the nearest object to the camera generate simulated bio-signal
stereo_vision: uses two cameras to track a colored object and generate simulated bio-signal
