The 3rd party and our own libraries:

decimate  the C++ library implemented by mosalam to decimate the acquired signal
getpot  the older library used to read and write config files, we started using inih instead later in the project
gstopwatch a simple stop watch used to show the time counter when recording the baseline data for the BCI task
inih the library used to read and write the config files for C/C++ programs. It preserves the comments (which start with #) in the config files
