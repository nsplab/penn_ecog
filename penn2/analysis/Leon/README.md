matlab_analysis_ecog
====================

This repo analyses and plots basic data using regression over different frequency bands against the force sensor input signals

main:
=============

analyse_data.m

Is the main file, every variable is set here at the beginning, where we can set which bands to analyze, either the beta or the high gamma
The file needs no inputs and it plots:

- Raw data and 1 selected channel's spectrogram
- Regression weights as well as the P-values for each of the factors
- Alginment both with rising and falling edges for beta and high gamma bands





auxiliar
=============


findNearest.m 

This function matches the indexes of the original value and the samples generated by the spectrogram function

labelize.m

This functions accepts a threshold and float array and creates 0s and 1s labels

return_batch.m

Using the variables concerning the original sampling rate and the data file, it returns specific batches of data
the user can specify the batch of data as well as the size
The function is debugged for the case when the batches are large than the data, and for the case where the last batched
may be incomplete

get_variables.m

Function to consolidate all the variables of interest from all the programs, so there are no coding mistakes. Be careful to set the right number of channels
if we do not set the right number of channels we will have problems when reading the data files from the binary format.
