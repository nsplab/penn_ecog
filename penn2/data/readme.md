When the Penn2 project runs the collected data files are created in this directory. An empty directory is added to the respository as the scripts and programs do not attempt to create this directory, if they do not find it, then they will crash.

After running a task, a directory and a file will be created in this directory:
1. a directory with a name like this subject_7_@_05_27_2014 which tells the subject number and the date of the experiment
2. a file with a name that starts with data_ this file contains the binary data recorded by the signal acsuision module
